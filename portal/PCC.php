<p>The Joint Training and Certification Program (JTCP) has developed a certification program in Portland Cement Concrete testing for construction materials lab technicians. To help reduce conflict and delay on construction projects within the state, Caltrans, in partnership with CSULB, has developed a series of joint training and certification programs.
</p>
<p>
Participants in Portland Cement Concrete will receive training and certification in various American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) methods pertaining to PCC testing in the field.
</p>

<h4>Who Should Attend</h4>

<p>This course has been developed for anyone seeking a basic understanding of hot-mix asphalt pavements. It is intended to focus on areas critical to the successful completion of an asphalt pavement.</p>

<h4>Completing the Program</h4>

<p>This certificate program consists of completing an online prerequisite, in-class training, and a lab.</p>

</p>

<p>The timely delivery of transportation improvement projects requires highly skilled, knowledgeable materials sampling and testing technicians. To help reduce conflict and delay on construction projects within the state, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), in partnership with CSULB, has developed a joint training and certification program in Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) testing for construction materials lab technicians.</p>

<p>TThe goal of this program is to ensure that all materials testers — both in the public and private sector — possess equal knowledge and skill in performing lab tests. This will, in turn, help ensure consistent testing, promote quality improvement, and foster positive working relationships between public and private sector employees.</p>

<p>Participants in this program will receive training and certification in various American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) methods pertaining to PCC testing in the field.</p>

<h4>Completing the Prerequisite</h4>

<p>To complete the prerequisite students must review provided resource material, view course videos, and pass an assessment quiz.</p>

<h4>Topics Include:</h4>

<ul>
<li>ASTM C 31/C 31M — 5: Standard Practice for Making and Curing Concrete Test Specimens in the Field</li>
<li>ASTM C 138/C 138M — 14: Standard Test Method for Density (Unit Weight), Yield, and Air Content (Gravimetric) of Concrete</li>
<li>ASTM C 143/C 143M — 15: Standard Test Method for Slump of Hydraulic Cement Concrete</li>
<li>ASTM C 172/C 172M — 14a: Standard Practice for Sampling Freshly Mixed Concrete</li>
<li>ASTM C 173/C 173M — 14: Standard Test Method for Air Content of Freshly Mixed Concrete by the Volumetric Method</li>
<li>ASTM C 231/C 231M — 14: Standard Test Method for Air Content of Freshly Mixed Concrete by the Pressure Method</li>
<li>ASTM C 1064/C 1064 — 12: Standard Test Method for Temperature of Freshly Mixed Hydraulic-Cement Concrete</li>
</ul>

<h4>Upon completion of this training, participants will be able to:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Use the methods employed for sampling PCC, and making molded PCC cylinder and beam test specimens for testing</li>
<li>Properly handle and cure the specimens</li>
<li>Determine the unit weight and air content (using gravimetric method) of freshly mixed PCC and calculate the yield volume of the concrete</li>
<li>Properly sample the freshly mixed concrete specimen, conduct slump test and judge whether or not the test was acceptable</li>
<li>Determine the slump of freshly mixed concrete</li>
<li>Properly sample freshly mixed concrete specimens from concrete mixers of the stationary, paving, and agitating and mixing truck types</li>
<li>Properly sample freshly mixed concrete specimens from continuous-mixing equipment</li>
<li>Determine the air content of freshly mixed concrete by the volumetric method</li>
<li>Determine the air content of freshly mixed concrete by the pressure method</li>
<li>Determine the temperature of freshly mixed hydraulic-cement concrete</li>
</ul>

<h4>Portland Cement Concrete – Training & Lab</h4>

<p>The Portland Cement Concrete testing certification program consists of both classroom and hands-on laboratory instruction. You must successfully pass the prerequisite course before registering in the Training & Lab course.
